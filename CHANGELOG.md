# Acra ChangeLog

## [0.77.0](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/releases/tag/0.77), April 13th 2018


_Core_:

- **MySQL databases**

	- Added support of MySQL: now you can connect Acra to MySQL databases. Works with any SSL mode: `require`, `allow`, `disable`.
	- Tested and supported on: MySQL, MariaDB.
	([#155](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/155), [#140](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/140))

	> Note: we don't support prepared statements yet. Coming soon!
	
	Read about new configurations at [AcraServer](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/wiki/How-AcraServer-works) page.

- **Keeping keys in secret**

	- Added encryption of keys folder: private keys are stored symmetrically encrypted by `master_key` ([#143](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/143)).
	- Added ability to generate public/private keys in the separate folders ([#148](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/148), [#142](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/142)).

	Read more about [key management](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/wiki/Key-Management).

- **Filtering requests for MySQL**

	- Added firewall component named [AcraCensor](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/wiki/acracensor) to handle MySQL `SELECT` queries. <br/>
	You can provide list of restricted or allowed tables and columns, as well as exact queries to handle. AcraCensor will pass allowed queries and return error on forbidden ones. Rules are configured and stored in `yaml` file. Each request is logged in real time, moreover all queries and their state are logged into separate log file. ([#151](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/151), [#138](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/138), [#136](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/136), [#132](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/132), [#125](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/125), [#108](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/108)).<br/>

	Check detailed instructions at [AcraCensor](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/wiki/acracensor) page.

- **Web Config UI**

	- Added lightweight HTTP [web server](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/wiki/AcraConfigUI) for managing AcraServer's certain configuration options.<br/>
	You can update proxy address and port, database address and port, zone mode and poison records handling. On saving new configuration, `acraserver` will gracefully restart and use these settings automatically. Web page access is restricted using basic auth. ([#153](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/153), [#141](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/141), [#123](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/123), [#111](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/111)).<br/>

	See screenshots and detailed instructions at [Acra Config UI](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/wiki/AcraConfigUI) page.


- **Logging**
	- Added support of new logging formats: plaintext, [CEF](https://kc.mcafee.com/resources/sites/MCAFEE/content/live/CORP_KNOWLEDGEBASE/78000/KB78712/en_US/CEF_White_Paper_20100722.pdf) and json.<br/>
	Logging mode and verbosity level is configured for AcraServer, AcraProxy and AcraConfigUI in corresponded `yaml` files. Log messages were slightly improved, custom error codes were added (which we believe will help to understand and debug any issues) ([#135](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/135), [#126](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/126), [#110](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/110)).
	
	Read more about log analysis at [Logging](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/wiki/Logging) page.


- **Tests**

	- Added many more integartion tests, fixed stability and handle more complicated use-cases ([#150](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/150), [#147](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/147), [#137](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/137), [#117](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/117), [#116](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/116), [#115](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/115)).


_Infrastructure_:

- **Docker support**
	
	- Added docker container for every main component: `AcraServer`, `AcraProxy`, `AcraConfigUI`, and keys generators (`AcraGenKeys` and `AcraGenAuth`). You can find containers in [/docker](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/tree/master/docker) folder or on [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cossacklabs/) ([#139](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/139)).
	- Updated [Getting started with Docker](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/wiki/Trying-Acra-with-Docker) guide to make starting Acra even easier.

	- Added easy-to-use docker-compose files to launch Acra in different environments, including key distribution. Possible configurations are:
		- `acraserver` + `acra_configui `
		- connecting to PostreSQL or MySQL databases
		- using Secure Session or SSL as transport encryption
		- with or without `acraproxy`
		- with or without zones.<br/>

		This is huge! We encourage you to try it! Check instructions and examples in [/docker](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/tree/master/docker) folder.  ([#154](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/154), [#146](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/146), [#134](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/134), [#133](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/133), [#102](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/pull/102)).

- **Go versions**
	
	- Updated Go versions support. Every Acra component can be built using Go >1.7, except `acra_rollback` that requires Go >1.8. No worries, you can download Acra as binary package anyway :)

- **OS**

	- Dropped support of Debian Wheezy (no autotests, no precompiled binaries anymore).


_Documentation_:

- Updated [QuickStart](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/wiki/Quick-start-guide) documentation about launching and building Acra components.
- Described how to setup [AcraCensor](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/wiki/acracensor) and [AcraConfigUI](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/wiki/AcraConfigUI).
- Added more details and described new options (like using TLS and connecting to MySQL databases) for [AcraServer](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/wiki/How-AcraServer-works) and [AcraProxy](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/wiki/AcraProxy-and-AcraWriter).
- Described new [logging](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/wiki/Logging) formats.
- Updated description of [Key management](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/wiki/Key-Management) approach we encourage you to use.
- Described docker components and ready-to-use docker compose configurations based on them at [Docker Readme](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/tree/master/docker).
- Updated [Getting started with Docker](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/wiki/Trying-Acra-with-Docker) guide.
